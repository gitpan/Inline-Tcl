INTRODUCTION:

Inline::Tcl -- Write Perl subroutines in Tcl.

Inline::Tcl lets you add Tcl procedures to perl code without using XS.

Example:

   use Inline Tcl => <<END;
   set asdf 2
   proc dummy { val } {
      puts "Dummy says \$::asdf + \$val = [expr \$::asdf + \$val]"
      incr val
      return [expr \$::asdf + \$val]
   }
   END

   $result = dummy(1);
   print "But returned $result\n";

When run, this complete program prints:

   Dummy says 2 + 1 = 3
   But returned 4

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

This module requires Inline.pm version 0.30 or higher to be installed.

To install Inline::Python do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

(On ActivePerl for MSWin32, use nmake instead of make.  This has not been
tested at all.)

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING:

This is alpha code.  I have no idea if it will work on any system but mine.
If it does work on your system, I would be interested in hearing from you.

It works on my system in any case:  suse7.0, kernel 2.2.17, tcl8.3.2.  
Makefile.PL will let you choose where to look for your installed version 
of Tcl: usually /usr/include or /usr/local/include.  In addition, you will 
be prompted for the location of the distribution.  It automatically searches 
in your home directory and lets you choose from any possibilities.  This 
requirement will be removed in future versions.

Currently Inline::Tcl only makes procedures available to perl.  Global
variables can only be referenced from within the Tcl procedure.

This module is not related to the Inline::Tcl module, but it might be 
valuable to have some compatibility between the two.

The Inline::Tcl mailing list is currently inline@perl.org. Send mail to
inline-subscribe@perl.org to subscribe.
